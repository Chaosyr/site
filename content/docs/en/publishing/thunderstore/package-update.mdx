## How to Update the Package

This will cover the simple topic of how to update your package.

Updating a package is nearly the same as uploading a package. There's just one catch; ***you must bump up your packages manifest version number***.

<Callout type="info">
  The Version System;

  If you recall the versions use the `Major.Minor.Patch` format.

  What this means is if your version number was lets say `1.0.4` and you had a update you can increment any part of the system to push a valid update.

  How would it be reccomended to uptick the version? Well think about it based on how large the Update is.

  * A Large Update with massive breaking changes.
  * A Minor Update with small changes.
  * A Patch Update with bug fixes.

  Based on that you can determine what to use for the uptick. 
  
  If the first bullet applies to the update uptick the Major, think of the Major as a peice for things like Code Rewrites or API refactoring, or removal of widely used code, and things of the like usually it is rarely upticked.

  If the second bullet applies to the update uptick the Minor, think of the Minor as a peice for things like Adding content to the package, removing content from the package that doesn't break another package dependant of it, tweaking content within the package.

  Lastly, if the third bullet applies to the update uptick the Patch, think of the Patch as a peice for things like Pushing out Bugfixes or Hotfixes without adding, removing or tweaking content of the package.

Now that you hopefully upticked your manifest's version number, if your keeping a Changelog, go and update the Changelog with a detailed "What did this update do/change in the package". Than with that out of the way zip the new package version and follow the [Upload Guide](./guides/publishing/thunderstore/package-upload) to upload it.
