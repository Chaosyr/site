# Setting Up Your Development Environment

This guide will walk you through setting up a complete development environment for Hytale modding, including all necessary tools and dependencies.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:
- A computer running Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux
- At least 8GB of RAM
- 10GB of free disk space
- Administrative privileges on your system

## Required Software

### 1. Java Development Kit (JDK)

Hytale modding requires Java 25 or later. We recommend using OpenJDK.

#### Windows
1. Download OpenJDK 25 from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/)
2. Run the installer with default settings
3. Verify installation by opening Command Prompt and running:
```bash
java -version
```

#### macOS
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install openjdk@25
```

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-25-jdk
```

### 2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

We recommend IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition for Hytale modding.

1. Download from [JetBrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
2. Install with default settings
3. Launch and complete the initial setup wizard

**Image suggestion: IntelliJ IDEA welcome screen or main interface**

### 3. Git Version Control

#### Windows
Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and install with default settings.

#### macOS
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install git
```

#### Linux
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install git

# Fedora/CentOS
sudo dnf install git
```

Verify installation:
```bash
git --version
```

## Setting Up Your Workspace

### 1. Create Project Directory

Create a dedicated folder for your Hytale mods:

```bash
mkdir ~/HytaleModding
cd ~/HytaleModding
```

### 2. Configure Git

Set up your Git identity:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### 3. Install Hytale SDK (When Available)

Once Hytale releases their official SDK:

1. Download the SDK from the official Hytale website
2. Extract to your HytaleModding directory
3. Follow the SDK-specific installation instructions

## IDE Configuration

### Setting up IntelliJ IDEA

1. **Configure JDK:**
   - Go to File → Project Structure → Project Settings → Project
   - Set Project SDK to your installed JDK 17

**Image: IntelliJ Project Structure dialog with JDK settings**

2. **Install Useful Plugins:**
   - Go to File → Settings → Plugins
   - Install recommended plugins:
     - Minecraft Development (if available)
     - GitToolBox
     - Rainbow Brackets

**Image: IntelliJ Plugins marketplace showing recommended plugins**

3. **Configure Code Style:**
   - Go to File → Settings → Editor → Code Style
   - Set up consistent formatting rules for your team

## Environment Variables

Set up environment variables for easier development:

### Windows
```cmd
setx JAVA_HOME "C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-25.0.x.x-hotspot"
setx PATH "%PATH%;%JAVA_HOME%\bin"
```

### macOS/Linux
Add to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

**Image: Environment variables dialog on Windows or terminal showing export commands**

## Testing Your Setup

Create a simple test to verify everything works:

1. Create a new directory: `mkdir test-project && cd test-project`
2. Create a simple Java file:

```java
public class HytaleTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hytale modding environment ready!");
    }
}
```

3. Compile and run:
```bash
javac HytaleTest.java
java HytaleTest
```

You should see: `Hytale modding environment ready!`

**Image suggestion: Terminal output showing successful compilation and execution**

## Next Steps

With your development environment set up, you're ready to:

- Create your first Hytale mod
- Explore the Hytale SDK documentation
- Join the modding community
- Set up version control for your projects

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Java not found:**
- Verify JAVA_HOME is set correctly
- Check PATH includes Java bin directory
- Restart your terminal/IDE

**IDE won't start:**
- Check system requirements
- Verify JDK installation
- Try running as administrator

**Git commands fail:**
- Ensure Git is in your PATH
- Check internet connection for remote operations
